# Covid-Bot
A bot to keep you updated while gaming.
With lockdown regulations slowly being lifted, people are starting to forget the virus is still out there. This carelessness can and will cause another outbreak if nothing is done about it.


My bot will show users the number of Covid-19 cases in real time. This will raise awareness and will remind citizens that the threat is far from gone. Without the correct precautions, our lives will go back to the lockdown phase and I know no one wants that to happen. Download CovidBot today and stay up to date.
